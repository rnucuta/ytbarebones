# YouTube Barebones

YouTube Barebones is a basic HTML version of YouTube meant for users with slow internet or low-powered hardware. It features the Trending page for over 15 countries (email me if you want me to add yours) and a search feature which allows you to access all videos on YouTube.

I originally built this so I could watch YouTube on my Raspberry Pi, and now I am thinking about making it a chrome extension so you can watch YouTube while doing work.

It is built with Node.js and uses Google's YouTube V3 API's.
